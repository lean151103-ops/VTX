2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on TX_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_0_rx_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_1_rx_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_2_tx_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_3_tx_0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin, sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0, clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0, clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>
